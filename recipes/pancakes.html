    <p><b>Description:</b></p>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. 
        Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this 
        was a family favorite.</p>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This 
        pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious 
        pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already 
        in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    
    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><b>Steps:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
        <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
